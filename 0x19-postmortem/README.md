Issue Summary:
Duration: April 9, 2024, 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM (UTC)

Impact: Picture this: You're cruising through your day, ready to conquer the digital world, and then BAM! Our web app decides to take an unexpected coffee break. Approximately 80% of our users were left hanging with frustratingly slow loading times or slapped in the face with HTTP 503 errors. What a way to start the day!

Root Cause: Turns out, our beloved load balancer decided to play favorites and sent all the traffic to a few servers while leaving others twiddling their thumbs. Misconfiguration strikes again!

Timeline:

10:00 AM (UTC): The day took a nosedive when monitoring alerts lit up like a Christmas tree, signaling trouble in paradise.

10:15 AM (UTC): Engineers embarked on a wild goose chase, suspecting backend servers were staging a revolt.

10:30 AM (UTC): With no smoking gun in sight, we pointed fingers at the innocent database, accusing it of being sluggish post-deployment.

11:00 AM (UTC): The plot thickened as the network joined the party, with suspicions of foul play in the air.

11:30 AM (UTC): It was time to call in the big guns—the network infrastructure team took the stage.

12:00 PM (UTC): Cue dramatic music! The culprit was unmasked—our load balancer had been playing favorites, causing chaos in the system.

12:30 PM (UTC): With a flick of the switch (and a few choice words), load balancer settings were set straight.

1:00 PM (UTC): Peace was restored in the digital kingdom, and users rejoiced as the app sprung back to life.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: Our mischievous load balancer decided it was the king of the playground, unfairly sending all the traffic to a select few servers, leaving others feeling left out and useless.

Resolution: The load balancer received a stern talking-to and was promptly reconfigured to share the love evenly among all servers. Automated checks were put in place to keep it in line.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Load Balancer Re-Education: We're sending our load balancer back to school to learn the importance of sharing. No more playing favorites!

Task: Organize a crash course for the load balancer on fair traffic distribution.
Automated Behavior Checks: To keep our load balancer in check, we're implementing automated checks to catch any funny business before it causes chaos.

Task: Develop scripts to monitor load balancer behavior and alert us if it starts acting up again.
User-Friendly Documentation: We're creating user-friendly documentation so everyone knows the dos and don'ts of load balancer configuration.

Task: Craft engaging documentation with visuals and clear instructions on load balancer setup and best practices.
Incident Response Improvements: We're reviewing our incident response process to ensure we can squash bugs and bounce back faster in the future.

Task: Schedule a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement in our response procedures.
With these measures in place, we're confident we can keep the load balancer in line and avoid any more impromptu coffee breaks for our web app.

So, grab your popcorn and join us on this rollercoaster ride through the world of tech mishaps and misadventures!
